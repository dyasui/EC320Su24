## Practice midterm

## Koans

R programming is an important part of this class. To help you learn R, this course will be using a tool called koans. Koans are small, interactive exercises that help you learn by doing. 

R Koans are inspired by the concept of Zen koans, which are short stories or questions that provoke deep thinking. In the context of programming, Koans are practical coding exercises that challenge you to think critically about how code works. They are designed to lead you through a series of tasks that progressively build upon one another, each highlighting a specific aspect of the R programming language.

The primary goal of using R Koans is to provide you with hands-on experience with R’s syntax--specifically we will focus on R packages that are contained in the tidyverse.

- **Weekly Exercises:** Starting from the second week, each student will be assigned a set of koans that cover the topics discussed in the lectures. These exercises will be part of your lab assignments.
- **Interactive Sessions:** During lab sessions, there will be dedicated time to work on your koans. 

You don't need to know how to program to do these koans. They get gradually harder as you go along, and are meant to be a way to learn about all the data analytics skills that an economist might need. For more information about learning R, I recommend reading through the following passage in [The Tidy Econometrics Workbook](https://colleen.quarto.pub/the-tidy-econometrics-workbook/#programming-in-r). 

The koans for this course are found in the following repository: [tidyverse_koans](https://github.com/ajdickinson/tidyverse_koans).
