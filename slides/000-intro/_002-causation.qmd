## Causal identification

Common refrain.^[[Ex.]{.ex} [Number of people who drowned by falling in pool and Nicolas Cage films](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)]

> "Correlation does not necessarily imply causation."

<br>

. . .

Why might correlation fail to describe a causal relationship?

## Causal identification{data-visibility="uncounted"}

Common refrain.^[[Ex.]{.ex} [Number of people who drowned by falling in pool and Nicolas Cage films](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)]

> "Correlation does not necessarily imply causation."

. . .

Correlation may imply causation if we assume ["all else equals"]{.note}

- Hold everything fixed

. . .

This assumption is fragile in the real world.

Do you think this is a causal statement?

## Experiments

How can we ensure the [all else equals]{.blue} assumption holds?

. . .

> Randomization

. . . 

[Randomized Controlled Trails]{.hii} (RCT)

- widely used across many scientific disciplines^[Medicine, psychology, education, agronomics among many others]
- often touted as the _gold standard_ of causal identification
- use [randomization]{.blue} to ensure [all else equals]{.blue}

. . .

In 2019, the Nobel Prize winners adapting RCTs to projects in development economics^[Duflo, Banerjee, and Kremer]

## Experiments [Ex.]{.ex}

[Research question]{.hi}

> _Does health insurance improve health?_

. . .

The [all else equals]{.hi} assumption would require:

- all preexisting correlates with health must be the same across insured and uninsured

. . .

What would violate this assumption?

. . .

> _If more money is correlated with better health, and the average income of those who buy health insurance is higher, then we violate this assumption_

---

## Experiments [Ex.]{.ex}

_But what if health insurance is randomly assigned?_

- Then, assuming the assignment is perfectly random across a large enough sample size, this assumption becomes much more palatable

. . .

[Oregon Health Insurance Experiment](https://www.nber.org/programs-projects/projects-and-centers/oregon-health-insurance-experiment?page=1&perPage=50){preview-link="false"}

> [The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment is a landmark study of the effect of expanding public health insurance on health care use, health outcomes, financial strain, and well-being of low-income adults... In 2008, the state of Oregon drew names by lottery for its Medicaid program for low-income, uninsured adults, generating just such an opportunity. This ongoing analysis represents a collaborative effort between researchers and the state of Oregon to learn about the costs and benefits of expanding public health insurance.]{.tiny}

## Natural experiments

. . .

> An external, non-experimental factor creates circumstances that resemble a controlled experiment

. . .

<br>

Real-world events provide opportunity to compare similar groups

<br>

With some assumptions, researchers infer the causal relationships examining differences in outcomes between groups

## Natural experiments

Any examples of [natural experiments]{.note} that come to mind?

. . .

Here are some of the more famous ones:


1. Vietnam draft lottery

::: {.notes}
During the Vietnam War, the U.S. used a lottery system to determine which young men would be drafted into military service. 
The random assignment of draft numbers created a natural experiment that researchers have used to study the causal effects of military service on various outcomes, including earnings, education, and long-term health.

. . .

2. The Mariel Boatlift

::: {.notes}
The Mariel Boatlift: In 1980, Fidel Castro unexpectedly allowed around 125,000 Cubans to leave for the United States, creating a sudden increase in the supply of low-skilled labor in Miami. 
This "supply shock" has been used as a natural experiment to study the effects of immigration on the wages and employment opportunities of native workers in the receiving country.

3. Maimonides' Rule and Class Size

::: {.notes}
In Isreal, classes of students are split if they exceed multiples of 40. 
Students in a class of 80 would have similar outcomes to those in a class of 81,
except that the class of 81 would benefit from having a higher teacher-to-student ratio.
:::

. . .

4. The Opening of the London Congestion Charge

::: {.notes}
In 2003, London introduced a congestion charge for vehicles entering the city center during peak hours.
The charge aimed to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. 
The introduction of the charge provided a natural experiment to study its effects on air pollution, traffic congestion, and public transportation use.
