## Course site

I use [GitHub]{.hi} to host a separate site with all the course materials

You can find a link to it [here](https://github.com/dyasui/EC320S24) or on the Canvas homepage

. . .

<br>

I use it because:

1. I am adapting from previous class github repo
2. it is convenient to track changes and keep everything up to date
3. acts as a secondary site in case Canvas dies

. . .

I will try my best to keep Canvas up to date,
but if you can't find something there check the github.

. . .

All video recordings will only be available on Canvas

## In EC320

An applied econometrician^[Applied econometrician = Practitioner of econometrics, e.g., analyst, consultant, data scientist.] needs a solid grasp on (at least) three areas:

1. The underlying [theory]{.hi} (assumptions, strengths, weaknesses).
1. An ability to load, aggregating, joining, visualizing [large datasets]{.hi}.
1. [Applying]{.hi} the theoretical methods to [actual data]{.hi}.

. . .

This course aims to deepen your knowledge in each of these three areas.
